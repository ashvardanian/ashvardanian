# Hey, I'm Ash â€” I Love Building Infrastructure

- Building [Unum Cloud](https://unum.cloud) since 2015.
- Computer Science & AI researcher (unpublished, by choice).
- Twice an Astrophysics dropout, lifelong Bioinformatics fan.
- Investing in deep-tech, cloud, & semiconductors.
- Fluent in English, Russian & Armenian.
- Lived in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡² & ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©.
- Frequent host of "Systems" meetups in [Armenia](https://github.com/cpp-armenia/meetings), and beyond.

For ~20 years, Iâ€™ve been coding in C++, CUDA, and Python â€” optimizing Assembly on x86 & ARM.
Prefer spaces over tabs, east-const, and procedural code over OOP or functional abstractions.

## Repositories

- __[USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/USearch)__ - a universal search engine powering many databases, AI labs, and experiments in Natural Sciences. Compact C++ core with 10+ language bindings â€” 10â€“100Ã— faster than Meta FAISS for vector search and far beyond Apache Lucene.
- __[StringZilla](https://github.com/ashvardanian/StringZilla)__ - SIMD, SWAR, and CUDA-accelerated string algorithms for search, matching, hashing, and sorting at Web Scale and Bioinformatics scale. Hundreds of hand-tuned kernels with manual multi-versioning, exposed to C, C++, Rust, Python, Swift, and JavaScript, up to 10Ã— faster on CPUs and 100Ã— faster on GPUs.
- __[SimSIMD](https://github.com/ashvardanian/SimSIMD)__ - a large collection of mixed-precision vector math kernels for C, Python, Rust, and JavaScript. Designed for linear algebra, scientific computing, statistics, information retrieval, and image processing, delivering consistent SIMD speedups over BLAS and NumPy on both x86 and ARM architectures.
- __[UCall](https://github.com/unum-cloud/UCall)__ - a kernel-bypass web server backend for C and Python built on io_uring. Achieves 70Ã— higher throughput and 50Ã— lower latency than FastAPI for real-time workloads, including serving compact AI models.
- __[UForm](https://github.com/unum-cloud/UForm)__ - tiny multimodal AI models with state-of-the-art parameter and data efficiency. Compatible with Python, JS, and Swift, serving as a lightweight alternative to OpenAI CLIP for on-device and server inference.
- __[ForkUnion](https://github.com/ashvardanian/ForkUnion)__ - ultra-low-latency parallelism library for Rust and C++. Avoids allocations, mutexes, and even Compare-And-Swap atomics â€” achieving up to 10Ã— speedups over Rayon and TaskFlow.

Some of those are used in [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse), [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb), [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb), [ScyllaDB](https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb), [yugabyteDB](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db), [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [SemanticKernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), [MemGraph](https://github.com/memgraph), [Vald](https://github.com/vdaas/vald), and many other less "open" systems, such as competitive AI labs, Cloud companies, Fortune 500, iOS and Android apps with 100M-1B MAU, and government agencies.
