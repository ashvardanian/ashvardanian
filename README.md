# Hey, I'm Ash!

I've designed Search & AI infra software deployed on hundreds of millions of devices, which power some of the largest tech companies, unicorns and decacorns, AI research labs, and defense and intelligence organizations worldwide.
In short:

- CS/AI researcher.
- Astrophysics dropout.
- Ex Investor: cloud & semiconductors.
- Fluent in English, Russian, & Armenian.
- Building the [Unum](https://unum.cloud) AI infra project since 2015.

I spent most of the last 20 years writing code.
Mostly __GPGPU, SIMD Assembly, userspace storage drivers, and networking protocols__.
I strongly believe, that:

- procedural programming eats object-oriented for breakfast,
- abstractions are mostly evil, they are never zero-cost,
- infrastructure is fun,
- less code is better than more code,
- east-`const` is superior to `const`-west in C/C++,
- `goto` is a blessing, not a curse,
- good is the enemy of great â€“ elegant code is better than working code,
- the future of AI is amazing, and it's not LLMs or transformers,
- matrix multiplications are tasty, but literally everyone cooks them wrong,
- companies grow faster than people,
- pivots are the plague of Silicon Valley,
- hard things are easy, and easy things are hard,
- talent, ambition, and dedication are much more important than material resources,
- a single developer can beat a trillion-dollar company in almost everything.

## Repositories

I've designed and maintain the following libraries, datasets, and AI models:

- [StringZilla](https://github.com/ashvardanian/StringZilla) - faster strings with SIMD/SWAR for C, C++, Rust, Python, and Swift, _replacing GlibC and STL_
- [USearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/USearch) - single-file search engine for C, C++, Rust, Swift, Go, Java, C#, Python, JS..., _replacing FAISS_
- [UForm](https://github.com/unum-cloud/UForm) - small multimodal pre-trained AI models with SDKs for Python, JS, and Swift, _replacing CLIP_
- [UCall](https://github.com/unum-cloud/UCall) - networking server library for C and Python designed for Linux kernel bypass, _replacing FastAPI_
- [SimSIMD](https://github.com/ashvardanian/SimSIMD) - fast vector-vector math library for C, Python, Rust, and JavaScript, _replacing BLAS level 1_
